# EDIT INTERACTION IN POWER BI
Basically when we create a report in Power BI it will be interactive, every chart will be linked with each other.
# REQUIREMENT
lets say there is a requirement, when you click somewhere on a pie chart every other chart in the report should be interactive except Line chart!

So for above requirement there is a option called "EDIT INTERACTION". It basically have 3 options i.e, NONE, HIGHLIGHT,FILTER.

# FILTER
When you select FILTER, everything other than requires part will be filtered out!
# HIGHLIGHT
When you select HIGHLIGHT, only required part will be highlighted and other part will be fade away! (Like default Power BI interaction)
# NONE
When you select NONE, the respective chart will not be in sync with other chart.

# PROCEDURE

For every other chart other than the selected chart you will find 3 options which are mentioned above.Based on requirement we can choose the option.
